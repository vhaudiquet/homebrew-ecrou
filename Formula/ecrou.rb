# krunkit comes from, because the engine is dlopen'd from those kegs

    <<~EOS
      The binary is ad-hoc signed with the com.apple.security.hypervisor
      entitlement. Rebuilding from source (cargo) requires re-signing:
        codesign --force --sign - --entitlements packaging/homebrew/ecrou.entitlements target/release/ecrou
      `ecrou probe` reports this when the entitlement is missing.
